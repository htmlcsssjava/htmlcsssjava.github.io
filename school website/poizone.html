<p>Poizone. A stock FL Studio plugin that is often overlooked like most stock plugins. It has many presets which indluces: Arpeggios, Bass, Keyboard, Synth and
	Lead presets. It's a pretty old plugin compared to most but in my personal opinion
  it is pretty underrated. The UI may look pretty bad, but i say all producers should give it a shot!<p>
